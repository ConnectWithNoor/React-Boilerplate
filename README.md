## React Boilerplate

The repository contains the following libraries pre-setup for the quick building of the application without the need to setup and config the basics.

- ReactJS
- Redux Toolkit
- TailwindCSS
- React Router
- Axios (Intercepter, HttpService)
- Socket-IO-client
- Folder structure

The code inside the files are as dummy for a better understanding.

Please make sure to update the versions in the package.json file to keep the boilerplate up to date. Moreover, Additional setup of anything such as Docker etc are welcomed as a PR.

Thanks
